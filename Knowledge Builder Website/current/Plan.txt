The Plan

Objective for this version:
Create a homepage for the website.

Ideas:
Skip to navigation button
- Navbar
  - The navbar will be a holder for all the links when it is fit for a computer
    display. When the display is mobile, there will be a three line menu icon
    the user can click on to dropdown the navbar elements
  - Change the text in the navbar to icons and add more spacing to the navbar
    elements
  - Change navbar so that it only has links to Homepage, projects, and About
    Me page
    - Include All the games in the projects dropdown, split into categories

Main content
  - At the beginning, make a 2 column section that takes up the height of the
    user's screen
    - On the left side, put text that says, "Hi, my name is ___, and I am a"
      human being." or maybe some quote that is inspirational to me
    - On the right side, include a picture of a sprite of myself doing
      something cool

  - Projects section
    - Include circular informational cards that give a picture of the link
    on top and at the bottom it is a description of the link

  - Include about me section on this page?

-Bottom section
  - At the bottom, include a footer with a contact section

- Extra features
  - Add a back to top button somewhere
  - Add a light background color to the website
